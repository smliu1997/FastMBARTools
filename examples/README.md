Examples of using fastmbartools. 

butane-umbrella is an example of computing PMF along dihedral with umbrella sampling data.

hp1alpha-TRE is an example of computing PMF along Rg for HP1alpha dimer protein with temperature replica exchange simulation data. 

We will add one more example of 2d umbrella sampling.
